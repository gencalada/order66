### *Clone Assessment Log*

> *Order 66. We carried it out without question.*  
> *One command, and everything changed.*  
> *The Jedi… our generals… our brothers in arms—gone.*  
>  
> *But the silence that followed was worse than the blaster fire.*  
> *The mission ended, but the guilt didn’t.*  
> *So I’m running new drills now — not on the battlefield, but in the code.*  
> *Each assessment, a simulation to test control, precision, and purpose.*  
>  
> *Maybe if I rebuild myself, line by line…*  
> *I can save what’s left of who we were.*  
> *This isn’t about orders anymore.*  
> *It’s about redemption.*
